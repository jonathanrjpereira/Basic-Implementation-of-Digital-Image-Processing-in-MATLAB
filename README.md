# Basic Implementation of Digital Image Processing in MATLAB

Uses MatLab's Image Processing & Computer Vision Toolbox

Stock images such as cameraman.tif, pout.tif, circuit.tif, rice.png, coins.png, etc are built into MatLab & hence no external download is required.

Program codes can be run by pressing 'F5'.
